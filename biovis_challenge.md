# Bio+MedVis Challenge @ IEEE VIS 2023

This year’s challenge is currently in preparation but will be released soon. To
get the idea about the complexity of the challenge, please have a look at the
[challenge from 2022](http://biovis.net/2022/biovisChallenges_vis/) in the
meantime.

## Program

The Bio+MedVis Challenge, jointly organized by the [BioVis](../) and
[VCBM](https://conferences.eg.org/vcbm2023/) communities, will be organized as a
half-day event within the IEEE VIS 2023 conference. The program will consist of
invited talks (we are happy to announce that [Drew
Berry](https://www.wehi.edu.au/people/drew-berry) already confirmed our
invitation), presentations of accepted submissions, and other supplementary
sessions. Details will follow soon.

## Submission

Submissions will be considered for talk and/or poster presentations. You will be
requested to submit a two-page PDF abstract with unlimited additional figures
and a draft of your proposed poster (max 10MB) to the PCS. The deadlines will be
announced soon. Last year, the acceptance rate for presentations happened to be
89%, yet such acceptance rate is not guaranteed. Selected submissions will be
invited for talk presentations during the Bio+MedVis Challenge session within
the [IEEE VIS 2023](https://ieeevis.org/year/2023/welcome) conference.
