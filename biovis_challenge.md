# Bio+MedVis Challenge @ IEEE VIS 2023

## The Challenge

This year’s challenge will be based on a study recently published in Cancer Cell
by the
[ProCan](https://www.cmrijeansforgenes.org.au/research/research-teams/procan/procan-teams)
team ([Gonçalves et al.,
2022](<https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/S1535-6108(22)00274-4>)). The
study aimed to generate a comprehensive pan-cancer proteomic map of human cell
lines to aid in the discovery of cancer biomarkers and the development of new
cancer treatments. The main challenge will be to create an integrated overview
of cell-type / tissue-type / cancer-type distributions of both single proteins
as well as protein categories. There will also be a re-design challenge
connected to the improvement of the representation/interaction strategies used
for one of the figures in the paper.

### Biological Background and Data Description

The ProCan team used mass spectrometry-based proteomics to identify and quantify
proteins in 949 human cell lines that represented 28 different tissue types and
over 40 genetically and histologically diverse cancer types. These cell lines
were treated with 625 anti-cancer drugs and over 17,000 CRISPR-Cas9 gene
essentialities. The analysis resulted in a dataset of about 8,500 proteins that
were quantified across the cell lines, and these data capture evidence of cell
types and post-transcriptional modifications. Integrating multi-omics, drug
response, and CRISPR-Cas9 gene essentiality screens with a deep learning-based
pipeline revealed thousands of protein biomarkers of cancer vulnerabilities that
were not significant at the transcript level. The power of the proteome to
predict drug response was very similar to that of the transcriptome. Further,
random downsampling to only 1,500 proteins had limited impact on predictive
power, consistent with protein networks being highly connected and co-regulated.
This proteomic dataset is a high-quality resource for mechanistic investigation
of network organisation and regulatory principles of the proteome, as well as
for translational discoveries.

The dataset and the exact description of the challenge tasks will be coming very
soon. We are also planning an online Q&A session where you can ask questions
directly to the ProCan team: this will be announced well in advance.

## Program

The Bio+MedVis Challenge, jointly organized by the [BioVis](../) and
[VCBM](https://conferences.eg.org/vcbm2023/) communities, will be organized as a
half-day event within the [IEEE VIS 2023](https://ieeevis.org/year/2023/welcome)
conference. The program will consist of invited talks (we are happy to announce
that [Drew Berry](https://www.wehi.edu.au/people/drew-berry) already confirmed
our invitation), presentations of accepted submissions, and other supplementary
sessions. Details will follow soon.

## Important dates

-   Submission: <time>{{ site.IEEE_deadline_submission }}</time>
-   Notification: <time>{{ site.IEEE_deadline_notification }}</time>
-   Camera-ready version: <time>{{ site.IEEE_deadline_camera }}</time>

## Submission

Submissions will be considered for talk and/or poster presentations. You will be
requested to submit a two-page PDF abstract with unlimited additional figures
and a draft of your proposed poster (max 10MB) to the PCS. The deadlines will be
announced soon. Last year, the acceptance rate for presentations happened to be
89%, yet such acceptance rate is not guaranteed. Selected submissions will be
invited for talk presentations during the Bio+MedVis Challenge session within
the [IEEE VIS 2023](https://ieeevis.org/year/2023/welcome) conference.
