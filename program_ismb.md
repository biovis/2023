**Speaker Biography:**
Marc Baaden, research director at the CNRS in Paris, is a computational chemist
working in the field of structural bioinformatics. His research focuses on
interactive molecular modeling approaches for biological systems and has
included virtual reality approaches since 2007, then Citizen Science, and more
recently the Internet of Things. He develops scientific visualization approaches
as well as original tools related to Big Data and immersive analytics using
virtual reality equipment. Using the Unity game engine, he has designed the
UnityMol platform as a development framework for academic contexts and for
collaboration with industry partners and the public. His research combines
simulations of biological macromolecules and bioinformatics with
high-performance computing, virtual reality, visualization, and dissemination
activities.
