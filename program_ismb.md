**Abstract:** To what extent do we still need molecular graphics in today's
scientific landscape? Despite its long history and high level of maturity,
molecular graphics remains an indispensable tool for scientific understanding
and discovery, constantly facing new challenges. These currently include the
ability to visualize complex molecular relationships and interactions, with the
goal of scaling the size and scope of systems currently under investigation. In
addition, molecular graphics programs must adapt to experimental (r)evolutions
to remain relevant in the field.

However, it is not enough to simply produce high quality visualizations.
Scientists must be able to share these complex visualizations with their
colleagues and with experts in other fields. The latest tools in molecular
graphics, such as AI- and data-driven approaches, interactive simulations,
augmented, mixed, and virtual reality, offer new ways to visualize and interact
with molecular data and models. These advances enable researchers to explore
scientific questions in new and innovative ways, but need to be more widely
adopted to become routine in scientific investigations.

**Speaker Biography:**
Marc Baaden, research director at the CNRS in Paris, is a computational chemist
working in the field of structural bioinformatics. His research focuses on
interactive molecular modeling approaches for biological systems and has
included virtual reality approaches since 2007, then Citizen Science, and more
recently the Internet of Things. He develops scientific visualization approaches
as well as original tools related to Big Data and immersive analytics using
virtual reality equipment. Using the Unity game engine, he has designed the
UnityMol platform as a development framework for academic contexts and for
collaboration with industry partners and the public. His research combines
simulations of biological macromolecules and bioinformatics with
high-performance computing, virtual reality, visualization, and dissemination
activities.

**Speaker Biography:**
Prof.Dr. Anna Vilanova is full professor in visual analytics (vis.win.tue.nl)
since October 2019, at the department of Mathematics and Computer Science, at
the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). She is also associated to the
Electrical Engineering department within the Signal Processing Systems at TU/e.
Previously she was associate professor for 6 years at the Computer Graphics &
Visualization Group at EEMCS at the University of Deft, the Netherlands. From
2002 to August 2013, she was Assistant Professor at the Biomedical Image
Analysis group of the Biomedical Engineering Department at TU/e. She is leading
a research group in the subject of visual analytics and multivalued image
analysis and visualization, focusing on Visual Analytics for high dimensional
data. She focuses on Biomedical applications, Diffusion Weighted Imaging and 4D
Flow. Her research interests include visual analytics, medical visualization,
volume visualization, multivalued visualization, and medical image analysis. In
2005, she was awarded a NWO-Veni personal grant with title “Visualization of
global tensor information for diffusion tensor imaging”. In 2013 she got a
NWO-Aspasia. She is member of the international program committee of several
conferences (e.g., IEEE Visualization and EG- IEEE VGTC-EuroVis). She has been
chair and editor of relevant conferences and journals in her field of research
(e.g., EuroVis 2008, Computer & Graphics, Computer Graphics Forum, IEEE Vis).
She was member of the steering committee of IEEE VGTC EuroVis (2014 -2018) and
VCBM since 2018. She is elected member of the EUROGRAPHICS executive committee
since 2015 and vice president of EUROGRAPHICS since 2019. She also became
EUROGRAPHICS fellow in 2019. She is elected member of IEEE VIS Steering
Committee (VSC) since 2021.
