**Abstract:** To what extent do we still need molecular graphics in today's
scientific landscape? Despite its long history and high level of maturity,
molecular graphics remains an indispensable tool for scientific understanding
and discovery, constantly facing new challenges. These currently include the
ability to visualize complex molecular relationships and interactions, with the
goal of scaling the size and scope of systems currently under investigation. In
addition, molecular graphics programs must adapt to experimental (r)evolutions
to remain relevant in the field.

However, it is not enough to simply produce high quality visualizations.
Scientists must be able to share these complex visualizations with their
colleagues and with experts in other fields. The latest tools in molecular
graphics, such as AI- and data-driven approaches, interactive simulations,
augmented, mixed, and virtual reality, offer new ways to visualize and interact
with molecular data and models. These advances enable researchers to explore
scientific questions in new and innovative ways, but need to be more widely
adopted to become routine in scientific investigations.

**Speaker Biography:**
Marc Baaden, research director at the CNRS in Paris, is a computational chemist
working in the field of structural bioinformatics. His research focuses on
interactive molecular modeling approaches for biological systems and has
included virtual reality approaches since 2007, then Citizen Science, and more
recently the Internet of Things. He develops scientific visualization approaches
as well as original tools related to Big Data and immersive analytics using
virtual reality equipment. Using the Unity game engine, he has designed the
UnityMol platform as a development framework for academic contexts and for
collaboration with industry partners and the public. His research combines
simulations of biological macromolecules and bioinformatics with
high-performance computing, virtual reality, visualization, and dissemination
activities.
